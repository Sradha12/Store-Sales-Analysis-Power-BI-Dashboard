# Store-Sales-Analysis-Power-BI-Dashboard
Created a Power BI dashboard to analyze store sales data (2019â€“2021) by region, category, and customer segment. Identified key trends like peak Q4 sales, top regions (West), preferred items (Phones, Chairs), and popular payment/shipping modes. Enabled data-driven decisions through interactive visuals.
