# Final Conclusion
To optimize performance, marketing efforts should be concentrated in the West region, particularly in California, which shows strong sales performance. High-performing sub-categories such as Phones and Chairs should be actively promoted to maximize revenue. Leveraging the peak sales season in Q4 with targeted promotions and ensuring inventory readiness can further boost results. Encouraging the use of online payment methods will enhance transaction efficiency and customer convenience. Additionally, developing loyalty strategies focused on the Consumer segment and promoting the reliability of Standard Ship Mode can help improve customer retention and satisfaction.
